# Low-level Bindings for libopenraw

[libopenraw](https://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/) is a library to help parsing
digital camera RAW files and metadata. This crate contains low-level bindings
to the original C-library. They were generated with
[bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).

I'm not part of the organization behind the project but I'm open for cooperation
or handing this crate over if there is interest. Big thanks to the original authors
of the library. Great job!
